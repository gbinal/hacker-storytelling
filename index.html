<h1>Hacker Storytelling</h1>

<p>Hacker Storytelling is a new way to tell stories on the Internet, in a way that is open by default.</p>

<p>Hacker Storytelling uses several tools to help you tell stories, and is completely stored and operating on Github.</p>

<p>There are several key technologies at play here:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Github Pages</strong></a> - A quick, easy and lightweight way to host websites on Github allowing anyone to build site with HTML, CSS and Javascript.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll#readme" target="_blank"><strong>Jekyll</strong></a> - Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website.</li>
    <li><a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Mustache Templates</strong></a> - A simple way to render structured data from JSON files, using basic HTML templates for displaying--instead of pulling directly from database.</li>
    <li><a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Deck.js</strong></a> - A JavaScript library for building modern HTML presentations. deck.js is flexible enough to let advanced CSS and JavaScript authors craft highly customized decks, but also provides templates and themes for the HTML novice to build a standard slideshow.</li>
</ul>

<p>These technologies will provide you with a simple, client-side toolbox for telling stories using:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Pages - Static HTML pages</li>
    <li>Blog - Chronological blog posts</li>
    <li>Data - Structured data lists and detail pages</li>
    <li>Presentations - Simple, flowing presentations</li>
</ul>

<p>These basic tools, plus the open, browser-based hosting environment introduced by Github, makes for a rich, online storytelling format.</p>
<p>This new approach to storytelling is not just about words.  Hacker Storytelling is about weaving in data and code, to make your stories richer and more meaningful.</p>
