     I'm still learning all about running Jekyll on Github Pages for all my projects. My mentor on the subject and Githubber, Ben Balter (<a href="https://twitter.com/BenBalter">@benbalter</a>), gave me some tips today on more efficient use of front end matter with Jekyll.
</p>
<p>
     When I moved from custom PHP sites to using Jekyll, I had many pages that were historically setup using a folder structure, such as <span>/foo/index.php, so when I migrated to run a Github I naturally setup as <span>/foo/index.html.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
     Ben pointed out that a better way to do this was using permalink frontmatter, allowing me to store them as /foo.html and use the permalink: /foo/ directive to control their output.
</p>
<p>
     This approach will leave me with a much cleaner, easier to manage file structure. I will be working to migrate all project site structures to use this methodology and add here as a Hacker Storytelling tip.
