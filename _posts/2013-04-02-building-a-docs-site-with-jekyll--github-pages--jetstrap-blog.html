{% include JB/setup %}<p>Today we are happy to announce the very first version of our Jetstrap Documentation site running on GitHub Pages using Jekyll as the site generator.If you don’t know about us, Jetstrap makes it super easy to build  Twitter Bootstrap interfaces and designs (try it, it’s free).Since our tool has a lot of little features, we’ve had a lot of requests for better documentation and tutorials.I wanted to build something that was easy to maintain, “open” so others could collaborate and submit content, and fast.GitHub Pages is perfect for that.</p>
