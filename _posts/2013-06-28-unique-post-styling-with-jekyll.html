{% include JB/setup %}<p>The other day Dave Rupert blogged about his new JavaScript plugin TimeJump.The Timejump post was a nice little read but the thing that caught my eye was the amount of time he had spent styling the post.I have been following Dave’s development for a while now and have been keeping an especially close eye on his work with Jekyll.So how did Dave actually achieve the custom styled post with Jekyll?After digging around I worked out that he had some sort of ‘Art Direction’ voodoo happening.</p>
