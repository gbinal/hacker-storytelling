<p>The <a href="http://digitalstrategy.apievangelist.com">Digital Strategy</a> is designed to track the progress and opportunities around the White House Digital Strategy, which is a mandate from President Obama that all federal agencies need to move towards machine readable by default.</p>

<p>I wanted a format for telling this story in a way that used the tools, data and APIs that are rolled out as part of the digital strategy.  The project uses the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pages</li>
<li>Blog</li>
<li>Agencies</li>
</ul>
<p>The Digital Strategy repository employs the Hacker Storytelling format, with all supporting available in a JSON file, with an upcoming infographic generated from the content and data.</p>

<p>The Digital Strategy story will be updated when changes are identified, with quarterly reviews of overall progress.</p>
