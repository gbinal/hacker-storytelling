{% include JB/setup %}<p>As preparation for the upcoming data expedition on Mapping the garment factories this weekend, several intrepid explorers have been collating data from brand supplier lists that identify the location of over 3,000 factories to date.The data is being published via a Google Spreadsheet, which means we can also treat it as a database, asking database like queries either within the spreadsheet itself, or via a webservice.The School of Data blogpost Asking Questions of Data – Some Simple One-Liners introduced the idea of using SQL – the Structured Query Language – to ask questions of a dataset contained in a small database populated with data that had been “liberated” using Scraperwiki.The query language that Google Spreadsheets supports is rather like a cut down version of SQL, so it can be a good place to start learning how to write such queries.The query language allows us to select just those databasespreadsheet rows where a particular column contains a particular value, such as rows relating to factories located in a particular country or supplying a particular brand.</p>
