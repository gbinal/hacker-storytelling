{% include JB/setup %}<p>These are questions asked by developers and should be answered by developers.So some friends and I got together and created Seattle Hacks, an open source, community powered event calendar and information resource for developers in Seattle.However, there was a massive problem with using an off-the-shelf CMS, blog or wiki tool that I was worried about: SPAM.Every time someone tries to make a dev calendar, it gets completely overrun with recruiters, pay-to-play events, and other crap hackers could care less about.Any site that allows the general public to make contributions will attract spam at a rate that is proportional to that site’s influence and traffic.</p>
