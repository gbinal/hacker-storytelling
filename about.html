<h1>About Hacker Storytelling</h1>

<p>I needed a way to evolve my storytelling in 2013.  I was introduced to all the technology that make up Hacker Storytelling over the 2012 year.</p>
<p>These tools are meant to give me quick and simple ways to tell powerful stories that are support by open data and open APIs.  As a programmer, I can build anything I desire, but simplicity, open and portability win.</p>
<p>I wanted a way to make sure every project saw the light of day from the beginning.  I have too many ideas, that have been developed behind the firewall and because they don't get 100% finished.  This new format requires I am open by default, and with very simple, client side building blocks it is easier for me to move projects along.</p>
<p>All projects (stories) I tell will start as Github repository, launch home page telling about the project and a blog to chronical the project.</p>
<p>Next I will be use JSON with Mustache Templates and presentations to support the complex sides of my projects and their surrounding stories.</p>
<p>My hope is to turn all my ideas, projects and stories into valuable content, stories, how-tos, data and presentations.  As I do this I will make sure everything is licensed and accessible in an open way for re-use and contribution.</p>
<p>I will continue to add to this project, and encourage you to do the same. Let me know your ideas.</p>
